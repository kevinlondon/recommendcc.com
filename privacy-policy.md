## Privacy Policy

Credit Card Recommender (CCR) operates as an Alexa Skill, created by Kevin London. Your privacy is critically important to us. 

We use your Personal Information only to provide a personalized user experience. By enabling the skill, you agree to use of information in accordance with this policy.

Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services.” Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.


### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

#### _Information You Provide to Us_

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:

*   **Profile and contact information:** We ask for your contact information to provide a link so you can apply to the credit card of your choosing. We do not store or provide your information to any other parties. 

We use your Personal Information only to provide a personalized user experience. By enabling the skill, you agree to use of information in accordance with this policy.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain users to CCR’s skill choose to interact with CCR in ways that require CCR to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that CCR gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. CCR collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the users's interaction with CCR. CCR does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information by not disabling the skill.

**Data Retention Policy**

We do not retain any user provided data.

**Log Data**

To be able to investigate issues with the skill, CCR stores logs with Amazon CloudWatch. These logs may included personally-identifying information as well, which are not exposed, sold or used besides the tracking of issues.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

CCR discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on CCR’s behalf, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees may be located outside of your home country; by using CCR’s skill, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. CCR will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, as described above, CCR discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when CCR believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of CCR, third parties or the public at large. CCR takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. CCR encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.
